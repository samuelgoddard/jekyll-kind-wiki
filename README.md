# Jekyll Netlify CMS Boilerplate

**A really simple Jekyll template for creating a fast, static website on Netlify with
a continuous deployment workflow.**

For help with templates, local development and other Jekyll related stuff, check out the excellent [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## Local Development

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```
Jekyll will watch your project folder for changes.

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site, and
[localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to log into the CMS.
